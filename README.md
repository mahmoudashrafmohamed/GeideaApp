# GeideaApp
android mobile application to display the User details in Native Kotlin


# Implementation
- In this project I applied Clean architecture with (MVVM Pattern + State Management) to apply Separation of concerns.
- using kotlin coroutines to handle heavy operations on the background thread.
- Using Hilt for dependency injection that will make code cleaner and more readable and handy when creating dependecies and testable easier.
- Single activity architecture its recommended from google to make app consume less resources.
- Using Retrofit to implement Api calls.
- Using Room for caching.
